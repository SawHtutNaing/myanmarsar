# Abstract

This report details the analysis, design, development, and evaluation of "Myanmar Sar," a comprehensive, web-based restaurant management system. The project is specifically tailored for a popular, mid-sized restaurant in Sule, Yangon, which currently relies on inefficient and error-prone manual processes. The primary aim of this project is to digitally transform the restaurant's core operations—including reservations, order-taking, kitchen communication, billing, and inventory management—to enhance operational efficiency, improve the customer experience, and provide valuable business insights through data analytics.

The report begins with a thorough investigation of the current business processes and their inherent challenges, including a narrative exploration of the daily operational friction. A detailed feasibility study is presented, evaluating the project's viability from technical, economic, legal, and operational standpoints, including a multi-year cost-benefit analysis and a review of alternative technologies. The system requirements are then meticulously defined, categorized using the MoSCoW method, and elaborated through comprehensive use case specifications and non-functional specifications.

The design phase is documented through detailed descriptions of system architecture, use case diagrams, class diagrams with full data dictionaries, and sequence diagrams for multiple complex workflows, providing a complete blueprint of the application. The implementation follows an agile DSDM methodology, with the development of the core "Order Management" module presented as the first time-box. This section includes textual descriptions of screen prototypes and a comprehensive test plan with dozens of detailed test cases to ensure software quality and robustness.

Finally, the report outlines granular plans for deployment, data migration, and staff training, followed by a concluding evaluation of the project against its initial objectives, a discussion of limitations and lessons learned, and a forward-looking roadmap for potential future enhancements. The entire document serves as a complete academic record of the project lifecycle, from conception to deployment planning, aiming for a word count appropriate for a final year submission.

# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1. Project Overview and Background

The restaurant industry in Yangon is a vibrant, chaotic, and highly competitive sector. While traditional establishments have long relied on their culinary appeal and reputation, the modern Food & Beverage (F&B) landscape increasingly demands operational efficiency and a superior customer experience. The proliferation of smartphones and mobile internet has fundamentally altered consumer expectations; patrons now expect speed, accuracy, and convenience as standard. The rise of digital technology has introduced new paradigms in restaurant management, with Point of Sale (POS) systems, Kitchen Display Systems (KDS), and online reservation platforms becoming standard tools for survival and success. According to a fictional 2024 survey by the "Myanmar F&B Association," restaurants in Yangon that adopted digital POS systems reported a 15% average increase in table turnover and a 25% reduction in ordering errors.

However, many small to medium-sized local restaurants, like our client "Myanmar Sar" in Sule, have been slow to adopt these technologies. They continue to operate using manual, paper-based systems for critical functions such as taking reservations, writing down customer orders, managing kitchen workflow, and processing payments. While this approach may have been sufficient in the past, it creates significant operational bottlenecks as the business grows. These inefficiencies manifest as longer customer wait times, errors in orders, difficulties in tracking sales, and an overall lack of data for strategic decision-making.

This project, titled "Myanmar Sar," aims to address these critical gaps by developing a bespoke, web-based restaurant management system. The system is designed to be a holistic solution, digitizing the entire workflow from the moment a customer makes a reservation to the final bill payment. It is built with the specific context of a Myanmar restaurant in mind, prioritizing an intuitive user interface that requires minimal training for staff who may not be tech-savvy.

The proposed system will be developed using a stack of proven and cost-effective technologies: PHP for the backend, MySQL for the database, and a standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. This choice ensures the system is robust, scalable, and maintainable without incurring high licensing fees, making it an accessible solution for the target business.

## 1.2. Current Business History and Processes

"Myanmar Sar" was established in 2015 and has since carved out a niche for itself in Yangon's dense culinary market, specializing in authentic, home-style Myanmar cuisine. Located in the prime commercial district of Sule, it attracts a diverse clientele of office workers, tourists, and local families.

**A Day in the Life: The Manual Workflow**
To truly understand the friction in their current process, consider a typical evening for a waiter named Aung.
*   **7:00 PM:** A party of four arrives. Aung greets them and scans the dining room. He consults the manager's logbook, a large, messy ledger filled with crossed-out names and scribbled times. He finds a table, but is unsure if it's reserved for a 7:30 PM booking. After a confusing exchange with the manager, he seats the party.
*   **7:10 PM:** Aung takes the order. The customers have questions about ingredients. Aung, being new, has to run to the kitchen to ask the chef. He returns, takes the order on his notepad: two Mohinga, one Shan Noodles with "no peanuts," and one Tea Leaf Salad.
*   **7:15 PM:** He tears the page from his notepad and walks it to the kitchen, placing it in a queue of other handwritten dockets. The head chef squints at Aung's handwriting, mistaking "no peanuts" for "more peanuts."
*   **7:35 PM:** The food comes out. The Shan Noodles are sent back due to the peanut allergy. Aung apologizes profusely and rushes back to the kitchen to get a new order prioritized, causing tension with the busy chefs.
*   **8:15 PM:** The party is ready to pay. They want to split the bill. Aung collects the greasy, stained paper dockets from the kitchen spike and retreats to a corner with a calculator. He manually adds up the items, makes a mistake, recounts, and finally produces four separate totals. The process takes ten minutes, during which the table is occupied and cannot be turned over.

This scenario, repeated countless times a day, highlights the systemic nature of the problem. It's not about a single employee's performance, but a flawed process that breeds inefficiency and errors.

## 1.3. Current Business Issues and Challenges

The manual system at "Myanmar Sar" presents a host of interconnected problems, as illustrated by the narrative above.

- **Operational Inefficiency:**
  - **Service Delays:** Every step is a manual hand-off, creating significant latency between taking an order and serving it.
  - **Table Turnover:** Slow billing and inefficient seating directly impact table turnover rates, capping the restaurant's revenue potential during peak hours.
  - **Staff Workload:** Waiters spend more time on logistics (walking to the kitchen, calculating bills) than on customer service.

- **High Potential for Human Error:**
  - **Order Inaccuracy:** Illegible handwriting, misheard requests, and forgotten modifiers are common. This leads to food wastage and customer dissatisfaction. A recent fictional online review stated, "Great food, but they got my order wrong twice. Not worth the hassle."
  - **Billing Errors:** Manual bill calculation is a major point of failure, leading to overcharging (customer anger) or undercharging (revenue loss).
  - **Reservation Conflicts:** The paper logbook is a recipe for disaster, frequently leading to double bookings or lost reservations.

- **Lack of Data and Analytics:** The business is flying blind.
  - **No Sales Data:** Management has no reliable way to know which dishes are popular, what the average spend per customer is, or who their most effective waiters are.
  - **No Inventory Insight:** The chef relies on gut feeling for inventory, leading to stock-outs of popular items or wastage of perishable goods.
  - **No Customer Data:** The restaurant has no record of its patrons, missing out on opportunities for loyalty programs or targeted marketing.

- **Scalability Issues:** The current system is at its breaking point. The restaurant cannot get any busier without a complete collapse in service quality. Expansion to a second location or launching a delivery service is an impossibility.

## 1.4. Proposed System Scope and Aims

**Aim:** To develop a robust, user-friendly, and cost-effective web-based system for "Myanmar Sar" restaurant that automates and streamlines its core business processes, thereby improving operational efficiency, enhancing the customer experience, and enabling data-driven management.

**Key Features within Scope:**
- **Digital Reservation Management:** A graphical, calendar-based interface to manage table bookings.
- **Digital Menu & Order Management:** An intuitive interface for waiters to take orders on a tablet. Orders are transmitted instantly to a Kitchen Display System (KDS).
- **Kitchen Display System (KDS):** A screen in the kitchen that displays incoming orders in a clear, prioritized format.
- **Automated Billing and Payment Processing:** The system will automatically generate an accurate, itemized bill, with options to split the bill.
- **Basic Inventory Control:** A module to track the stock levels of key ingredients, with alerts for low stock.
- **Centralized Admin Dashboard:** A secure web portal for the manager to configure the system, manage staff, and view data.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** The system will automatically generate reports on daily sales, best-selling items, and other key performance indicators.

# Chapter 2: Similar Product Comparison and Investigation

## 2.1. Introduction to Market Alternatives

To inform our design, we investigated two existing systems, giving them fictional names: "GourmetCloud," representing a high-end, cloud-based solution, and "StoreFront Pro," representing a traditional, on-premise system.

### **2.1.1. Competitor A: "GourmetCloud"**

- **Company Background:** A San Francisco-based startup, venture-capital-funded, targeting upscale restaurants in major global cities.
- **Target Market:** Fine dining restaurants, trendy cafes, and multi-branch chains that prioritize features and user experience over cost.
- **Pricing Model:** Subscription-based (SaaS). Tiers range from $79/month per terminal for the basic plan to $199/month for the enterprise plan with advanced analytics.
- **Feature Breakdown:**
  - **UI/UX:** Extremely polished, minimalist, and gesture-based. Runs as a native app on iPads.
  - **Table Management:** Advanced graphical interface with drag-and-drop seating and a detailed reservation timeline.
  - **Ordering:** Rich modifiers, easy-to-add customer notes, and prompts for upselling.
  - **Analytics:** Powerful analytics dashboard with predictive forecasting, customer spending habit analysis, and marketing integration.
  - **Integrations:** Integrates with dozens of third-party services for accounting (Xero), delivery (UberEats), and reservations (OpenTable).

- **SWOT Analysis for GourmetCloud:**
  - **Strengths:** Superior user experience, powerful features, scalable cloud architecture.
  - **Weaknesses:** High recurring cost, dependent on a stable internet connection, may be too complex for a simple restaurant.
  - **Opportunities:** Expanding into the mid-tier market with a "lite" version.
  - **Threats:** Competition from more affordable, localized POS systems.

### **2.1.2. Competitor B: "StoreFront Pro"**

- **Company Background:** An older, established company that has been selling POS systems for two decades.
- **Target Market:** Small, independent retail stores and restaurants.
- **Pricing Model:** One-time perpetual license fee ($1,200) plus an optional annual support contract ($300/year).
- **Feature Breakdown:**
  - **UI/UX:** Dated, text-heavy interface. Runs on Windows-based touch terminals. Less intuitive, requiring significant staff training.
  - **Reliability:** Extremely robust and fast, as it runs on a closed local network. Not affected by internet outages.
  - **Features:** Provides all the basic functions (order taking, billing, basic reports) but lacks advanced capabilities. The KDS is a separate, expensive add-on.
  - **Customizability:** The system is fairly rigid, with limited options for customization.

- **SWOT Analysis for StoreFront Pro:**
  - **Strengths:** High reliability, affordable one-time cost, not internet-dependent.
  - **Weaknesses:** Poor user interface, limited feature set, difficult to scale.
  - **Threats:** Losing market share to modern, user-friendly cloud systems like GourmetCloud.

## 2.2. Conclusion of Investigation

The investigation reveals a clear gap for a "best of both worlds" solution for a client like "Myanmar Sar."
- **GourmetCloud** is too expensive and its reliance on the cloud makes it unsuitable for a location with unstable internet.
- **StoreFront Pro** is reliable and affordable but its poor usability would be a major hurdle for staff, and its lack of an integrated KDS fails to solve a key operational bottleneck.

Therefore, the "Myanmar Sar" project is justified. We will build an **on-premise** system for reliability, but with a **modern, intuitive user interface** inspired by GourmetCloud, and with an **integrated KDS** as a core, non-negotiable feature.

# Chapter 3: Feasibility Study

## 3.1. Technical Feasibility & Technology Alternatives

- **Methodology:** As previously stated, DSDM/Agile is the chosen methodology. Its iterative nature is perfect for this project.

- **Technology Alternatives Analysis:**
  - **Backend:**
    - **PHP (Chosen):** Mature, vast community, excellent documentation. The LAMP stack is easy to set up and very cost-effective. Performance is more than sufficient for an on-premise web application of this scale.
    - **Python (with Django/Flask):** Also an excellent choice. Django's "batteries-included" approach could speed up development. However, the learning curve is steeper for beginners, and deployment can be slightly more complex than a standard LAMP stack.
    - **Node.js (with Express):** Its asynchronous nature offers high performance, but this is less critical for an internal application with a limited number of concurrent users. The single-threaded nature of Node.js also requires more careful error handling to prevent the entire application from crashing.
    - **Justification:** PHP was chosen for its simplicity, ease of deployment, and widespread support, which align perfectly with the project's goal of creating a maintainable, cost-effective system.

  - **Database:**
    - **MySQL (Chosen):** A world-class, reliable, open-source relational database. It is perfect for the transactional data of a POS system (orders, bills, etc.).
    - **PostgreSQL:** Another outstanding open-source relational database, often considered more feature-rich and standards-compliant than MySQL. However, for the scope of this project, these advanced features are not necessary, and MySQL is arguably easier for beginners to manage.
    - **MongoDB (NoSQL):** A NoSQL database offers flexibility but lacks the rigid structure and transactional integrity (ACID compliance) of a relational database, which is critical for financial data like orders and bills. It would be a poor choice for this project.
    - **Justification:** MySQL provides the required reliability and structure for our transactional data, while being easy to set up and manage.

  - **Frontend:**
    - **Bootstrap (Chosen):** A CSS framework that allows for rapid development of a responsive, mobile-first UI without the overhead of a full JavaScript framework.
    - **React/Vue.js:** These powerful JavaScript frameworks would create a more dynamic, single-page application feel. However, they add significant complexity to the development and build process, which is not justified for the scope of this project. A simpler, server-rendered application with Bootstrap is sufficient and easier to maintain.
    - **Justification:** Bootstrap provides the necessary UI components and responsiveness with minimal complexity.

## 3.2. Economic Feasibility & ROI Analysis

- **Costs:**
  - One-time Hardware Cost: $2,600
  - Development Cost (Academic): $0
  - Annual Maintenance (Estimated): $300 (for potential hardware replacement/repairs)

- **Financial Projections (3-Year ROI Analysis):**

|                                      | Year 1      | Year 2      | Year 3      |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Benefits**                         |             |             |             |

| Reduced Billing Error Loss           | $1,000      | $1,000      | $1,000      |
| **Total Annual Benefit**             | **$15,500** | **$16,225** | **$16,986** |
|                                      |             |             |             |
| **Costs**                            |             |             |             |
| Initial Hardware Investment          | $2,600      | $0          | $0          |
| Annual Maintenance                   | $300        | $300        | $300        |
| **Total Annual Cost**                | **$2,900**  | **$300**    | **$300**    |
|                                      |             |             |             |
| **Net Annual Cash Flow**             | **$12,600** | **$15,925** | **$16,686** |
| **Cumulative Cash Flow**             | **$12,600** | **$28,525** | **$45,211** |

- **Payback Period:** The initial investment is $2,900. The net cash flow in Year 1 is $12,600. The payback period is therefore very short, approximately **3 months** ($2,900 / $15,500 * 12 months).
- **Return on Investment (ROI) over 3 years:**
  - Total Net Benefit = $45,211
  - Total Cost = $2,900 + $300 + $300 = $3,500
  - ROI = (($45,211 - $3,500) / $3,500) * 100 = **1191%**

**Conclusion of Economic Feasibility:** The project is overwhelmingly feasible from an economic standpoint, with a very rapid payback period and an extremely high ROI.

## 3.3. Legal, Ethical, Social, and Professional Issues (LESPI)

- **Legal:**
  - **Data Privacy:** We will adhere to Myanmar's Electronic Transactions Law. Any customer data (e.g., phone numbers for reservations) will be stored securely and used only for the purpose it was collected for.
  - **Labor Law:** The system's performance tracking features will not be used in a way that contravenes local labor laws regarding employee monitoring.
- **Ethical:**
  - **Transparency:** All staff will be informed about what the system tracks and why. The goal is to improve service, not to engage in punitive surveillance.
  - **Data Integrity:** We have an ethical duty to ensure the system is rigorously tested to prevent bugs that could lead to incorrect billing.
- **Social:**
  - **Digital Divide:** We must be mindful that not all staff will be comfortable with technology. The training plan is critical to ensure no employee is left behind.
  - **Job Augmentation:** We will frame the project as a tool to make staff's jobs easier and more fulfilling, not as a step towards replacing them.
- **Professional (BCS Code of Conduct):**
  - **Public Interest:** We will ensure the system is reliable and does not harm the public (customers or staff).
  - **Professional Competence:** We will only undertake tasks for which we are competent and will be transparent about the system's limitations.
  - **Integrity:** We will act with honesty and integrity in all our dealings with the client.

## 3.4. Operational Feasibility & Change Management Plan

- **Stakeholder Analysis:**
  - **Owner:** High interest, high power. Must be kept fully informed and involved in key decisions.
  - **Manager:** High interest, medium power. Key user for admin functions; their buy-in is critical.
  - **Waiters/Chefs:** Medium interest, low power. They are the primary end-users. Their feedback is essential for usability.
- **Communication Plan:** A weekly 30-minute progress meeting with the owner/manager. Regular, informal feedback sessions with waiters.
- **Training Plan:** A detailed, hands-on training plan as outlined in Chapter 6.
- **Overcoming Resistance:**
  - **Involve Staff Early:** Get feedback on UI prototypes from waiters.
  - **Highlight Benefits:** Show them how the system reduces their stress (no more handwriting, no more manual calculations).
  - **Appoint Champions:** Identify one or two tech-savvy waiters who can act as "champions" to help their colleagues.

```

## 5.2. Detailed Screen Descriptions

- **Screen 1: Table Layout (Waiter Dashboard)**
  - **Layout:** A full-screen graphical view. The background is a static image of the restaurant's floor plan. On top of this, rectangular or circular shapes represent the tables.
  - **Components:**
    - Each shape has the table name (e.g., "T1", "T2") inside it.
    - The color of the shape indicates status: Green for 'available', Yellow for 'occupied', Red for 'needs_cleaning'.
    - A "Logout" button is in the top-right corner.
  - **Interaction:** Tapping on a table shape navigates the user to the Order Entry screen for that table.

- **Screen 2: Order Entry**
  - **Layout:** A two-column layout.
  - **Left Column (Menu):**
    - A dropdown or series of buttons for menu categories (e.g., "Curries", "Noodles", "Drinks").
    - Below this, a scrollable list of menu items within the selected category. Each item shows its name and price.
  - **Right Column (Current Order):**
    - Displays the table name at the top.
    - A list of items already added to the order. Each row shows: Item Name, Quantity (with +/- buttons to adjust), Price. A small "notes" icon and a "remove" (X) icon are also present.
    - At the bottom, the subtotal, tax, and total are displayed.
    - Two prominent buttons at the very bottom: "Send to Kitchen" (blue) and "Go to Bill" (green).
  - **Interaction:** Tapping an item on the left adds it to the right. Tapping the buttons on the right modifies the order.
